# 🧠 Enhancing PID Control with LLMs — Fine-Tuning & Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This project explores the intersection of control systems and large language models (LLMs), specifically targeting **improved performance in PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers** through **domain-specific fine-tuning** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Built on top of the LLaMA 3 architecture, this research leverages LoRA and QLoRA techniques to specialize general-purpose LLMs in the field of industrial control.

## 🎯 Purpose & Motivation

PID controllers are fundamental to control systems in engineering, robotics, and automation. However, tuning them requires domain expertise and trial/error. This project aims to:

-  Improve PID tuning efficiency using LLMs fine-tuned on domain-specific data  
-  Assist engineers with explanations, parameter suggestions, and system diagnostics  
-  Explore the capabilities of RAG in delivering real-time, context-aware responses  
-  Bridge the gap between traditional control theory and modern AI capabilities
